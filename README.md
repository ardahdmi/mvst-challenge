## Future Improvements and Acknowledgements

### Without time constraints and aim to improve this project, I would add the following steps to further improvements:

1. **GraphQL Pagination**
2. **GitHub Login**
3. **Statistical Analysis and Several Charts**
4. **Testing**

### Acknowledgements

It's been a while since I last worked with a time constraint. I must admit, I really liked it! I decided to use GraphQL API and learnt quite a lot. Even though I had several deadlines coming up, I wanted to work on it as much as I could. All in all, it was a nice experience and thank you for reminding me that time pressure does stimulate learning!

I would deploy the app but since I couldn't get tokens from the user, it wouldn't make any sense. So I decided not to..

_PS: I would love to get feedback and guidance about my mistakes and specifically, pagination and getting OAuth token from the user_
